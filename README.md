# flawless-cooking

This is a website for kids cookery classes based in Cork. Complete with enquiry form, downloadable sample recipe and an about section. Flawless Cooking is a fictional cookery school, however, it is an actual cookery blog that I own. 
This website has been created as the first Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma.
